# Popular Merge Intervals Problems

Many interval-related questions require **merging** or **inserting** intervals, finding **common free/busy slots**, or determining how many **resources** are needed to accommodate overlapping events. A common approach is:

1. **Sort** intervals by their start times.  
2. **Traverse** the sorted list, merging overlapping intervals if necessary (or performing the relevant logic like counting or inserting).

Below is a collection of well-known **Merge Intervals** style problems on LeetCode.

## Merge Intervals Template

Below is a general Python template for merging intervals. Variations of this approach can be adapted for more specific interval problems (e.g., adding intervals, finding overlaps, etc.).

```python
def merge_intervals(intervals):
    """
    Merges overlapping intervals in a list of intervals.
    Each interval is represented as [start, end].
    Returns a new list of merged intervals.
    """

    if not intervals:
        return []

    # 1. Sort intervals by start time
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    merged = [intervals[0]]

    for current in intervals[1:]:
        prev = merged[-1]

        # 2. If current overlaps with the last interval in 'merged'
        if current[0] <= prev[1]:
            # Update the end to the max end of both
            merged[-1][1] = max(prev[1], current[1])
        else:
            # No overlap, just add to the list
            merged.append(current)

    return merged
